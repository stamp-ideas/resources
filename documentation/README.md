Documentation

This is the documentation for every process we have at Stamp Ideas. It's meant to be an organizing tool for us to see how we do what we do, and ways to optimize the processes as a whole.

## Email Development

### Step 1: Duplicate Previous Job Folder

If there's a simliar email that has been used in the past, **duplicate** that folder and **change the Job number.** Check to see if there's an `index.html`. If there is, delete it. Rename the `indexOrig.html` file to `index.html`. This will be the `index` file you work from.

### Step 2: Crop & Export The PSD

Check to see what's changed from the previous email, if applicable. There's no need to update an image if it hasn't changed *visually*. (Note that the anchor link will likely have still changed.)

#### Optimizing Images

To optimize an image, use 'Save for Web' in Photoshop (`Shift+Alt+Cmd+S`). Make sure get reduce the file to the smallest size possible. Emails are sent to *all* users, including those on mobile.

**If possible, all emails should be under `102KB`.** Gmail clips off anything after this limit.
