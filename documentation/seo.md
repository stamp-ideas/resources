## SEO

### Log into Webmaster Tools

Login as `lwtconnect@gmail.com` and navigate to the site you're working on. 

### Determine what's most important

There may be quite a few things that need to be updated on the site, including meta descriptions, titles, server errors, robots.txt, and more. Choose what's most important for this client and work on that for an hour or so.

### Tips & Tricks

If you're working on meta titles and/or descriptions, remember that most of our websites are template-driven, which means you need to put some variable in the title and description tag to make it unique. Titles usually use the `Page Title`, and descriptions usually use the meta description from the entry itself.

#### Check for Robots.txt

If this is missing, use this as a starting point: 

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /
