## SEO

### 1: Log into Webmaster Tools

Login as `lwtconnect@gmail.com` and navigate to the site you're working on. 

### 2: Determine what's most important

There may be quite a few things that need to be updated on the site, including meta descriptions, titles, server errors, robots.txt, and more. Choose what's most important for this client and work on that for an hour or so.

### 3: Prioritize Meta Titles & Descriptions

These are most apparent in Search Results, and they're arguably going to see the best ROI of your time. Plus, since most of our sites are template-based, one change can fix hundreds of crawl errors.

## 4: Don't Overdo It

If you see tons of errors when you first encounter a site, don't feel like you have to solve every problem _right now._ These jobs are most likely recurring, which means you'll have time again next month to work on fixing these.

### Tips & Tricks

If you're working on meta titles and/or descriptions, remember that most of our websites are template-driven, which means you need to put some variable in the title and description tag to make it unique. Titles usually use the `Page Title`, and descriptions usually use the meta description from the entry itself.

#### Check for Robots.txt

If this is missing, use this as a starting point: 

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /

#### Check for the Sitemap

It's unlikely that the site doesn't have a sitemap, but just in case check in `Crawl>Sitemaps` to make sure one is uploaded. If it's been a while since the sitemap was updated, generate and submit a new one.
